How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

By viewing diff we can check what is modified and check whether the change is right
or not.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Anyone can what is updated and changed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
pros-we can save a log.
cons-the log can be long.
	sometimes we can forgot.
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

multiple files are connected so they can be changed simultanously.    

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

by git log we can see commit history and by those id we can use git diff to find difference. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    by using get checkout we can go back to the previous version but we have to save 
	the latest id for backup to return.
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    check errors and many things
